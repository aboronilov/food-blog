DRINKS

RAINBOW PARADISE COCKTAIL WITH BLUE CURACAO

A delicious tropical cocktail for the summer months and perfect for Pride! This cocktail is not difficult to make; you don’t need a cocktail set and can serve it in a long drink glass or a hurricane glass. Pouring in the top layer is the trickiest thing, but with this paradise cocktail with blue curacao, you can really score points.

This island cocktail is made with grenadine syrup, pineapple juice, malibu, blue curacao, a little water and lots of ice. You can also use orange juice instead of pineapple juice and vodka instead of malibu, but then the order becomes a little different!

You will see that blue and yellow mix to green and the top layer remains beautifully blue. Voilà, your rainbow cocktail is ready! Serve with a lemon/lime slice or orange twist to finish it off. Do you use orange juice and vodka? Then you pour the orange juice over the grenadine and mix the vodka with blue curacao for the top layer. So you don’t use water in the recipe.

4 oz pineapple juice (or 160 ml)
2 oz malibu coconut rum (or 80 ml)
1 oz water (or 40 ml)
1 oz grenadine (or 40 ml)
½ oz blue curacao (or 20 ml)
ice (crushed or cubes)

SALADS

THE PERFECT GREEK SALAD

Fresh tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, crisp red onions, green peppers, romaine lettuce, savoury olives and crumbled feta cheese all tossed in a homemade lemony Greek salad dressing makes for the most perfect Greek salad. This refreshing classic salad takes just a few minutes to prep and toss together.

I love Greek food and I love salad... so it goes without saying that I love Greek salad. In fact, it is probably my favourite salad of all time. For starters, I could eat olives and feta cheese all day. I eat olives… out of the container… with a spoon… So, how can I say no to a salad that contains all of my favourites?

Prep and combine the romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, green peppers, olives and feta cheese in a large bowl. In a small bowl, make the lemon Greek salad dressing by whisking together the olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Add more black pepper to taste.

3 cups romaine lettuce, 1 cup grape tomatoes (or cherry tomatoes), 1 cup red onion chopped (roughly 1 small red onion), 1 + ½ cups cucumber sliced and chopped into quarters (roughly 1 medium cucumber), 1 medium green pepper chopped, ¼ cup whole Kalamata olives

HEALTHY


CHICKEN SATAY SALAD

Try this no-fuss, midweek meal that's high in protein and big on flavour. Marinate chicken breasts, then drizzle with a punchy peanut satay sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.

Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken. Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.

While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.

1 tbsp tamari, 1 tsp medium curry powder, ¼ tsp ground cumin, 1 garlic clove, finely grated, 1 tsp clear honey, 2 skinless chicken breast fillets (or use turkey breast)

SIMPLE HOMMADE CHICKEN RAMEN

Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour. The Honey’s parents are American ex-pats living abroad in Tokyo, Japan, and while visiting them over the last seven or eight years, he’s collected dozens of favorite eateries throughout the city.

There’s the best izakaya in Kichijoji, serving up casual Japanese pub food, and countless kiten-zushi restaurants, where my English-speaking Honey can choose small plates of freshly-made sushi from a moving conveyor belt without having to order in Japanese. He always makes sure to buy at least one Pocari Sweat from a vending machine (think Japanese gatorade), and of course, there’s his favorite ramen shop in Shinjuku, a tiny, crowded restaurant with a line out the door. Paintings of pigs adorn the walls, and big, steaming bowls of pork ramen are served to hungry patrons at a single bar counter.

Real Japanese ramen, the kind that my Honey tells stories about, takes years and great skill to perfect. I wanted to create a simple ramen noodle soup that reminded him of Japan, but could be made quickly, with ingredients on hand. I opted for chicken instead of pork, but kept the rest of the ramen vibe somewhat traditional: a killer chicken soup base with garlic, ginger, shitake mushrooms and soy sauce, filled with squiggly ramen noodles and slices of succulent chicken, and topped with fresh spring onions and a soft-boiled egg. My version is on the table in less than an hour – and half that if you opt for store-bought chicken – and while it might not be completely authentic, it’s a flavorful, comforting soup just in time for the unmistakably crisp, chilly autumn weather that these first days of October have ushered in.

2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*, kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, 2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil, 2 tsp fresh ginger minced, 1 Tbsp fresh garlic minced
